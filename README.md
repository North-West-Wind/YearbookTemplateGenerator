# YearbookTemplateGenerator (Gen圖文)
The generators I wrote specifically for my class in my Graduation Year Book.

## Gen圖文
圖 and 文 are both Chinese characters. 圖 means images, and 文 means texts. The program is called this because it generates images and texts.

This programs is written in TypeScript, with `node-canvas` as the main dependency.
